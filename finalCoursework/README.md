## Information from module supervisor
Your final coursework will be scrutinized for any generative AI content presented as your own. Therefore it is important to note the following guidelines when submitting your final coursework. If i have any concerns or doubts regarding your final coursework its authenticity I will be following the [guidelines of the QMUL academic misconduct policy](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/governance-and-legal-services/student-appeals/academic-misconduct/) and referring your assingment to the EECS Academic misconduct officer for further investigation. This means your assessment marks will not be released until a full investigation has been carried out by the Academic Misconduct Officer and QMUL ACCO.

Universities are required by the Office for Students to ensure that assessments are valid, reliable and ‘designed in a way that minimises the opportunities for academic misconduct and facilitates the detection of such misconduct where it does occur’ (Office for Students, 24 Nov 2022). So we do need to ensure that assessments are robust and ensure that they provide opportunities for students to demonstrate their achievements against the stated learning outcomes through their original work.  So it is important that you read the attached link. 

_The final coursework will be made available to you in week 4._

A majority of the knowledge and learning for the final coursework will be completed by week 7. Therefore students may start working on the final coursework as early as week 8 and start showing me (module organizer) drafts to ensure that you're on the right track.  If you choose to start your final coursework in week 12 please note that you will then only have 2 weeks to complete your final coursework.  Therefore you should begin working on your final coursework from week 8 so that I can support you and help you with areas in which you're in doubt. At any given time you may book a 1-1 feedback session with me to clarify doubts regarding the coursework or to show any draft work.
