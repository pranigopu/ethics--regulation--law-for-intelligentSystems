        2. Work in field
        3. Implementing organisational changes
3. Impact of AI and new opportunities and challenges
4. Need for ethical considerations in development and deployment of AI

### EXPANSION: Relevance of ethical and regulatory frameworks
- Existing frameworks (EF) can help guide ethical considerations
- Knowing about EFs can inform decisions to ensure smooth development and deployment \*
- Existing frameworks can help indicate areas of ethical deficiency in an organisation’s functioning and product

\* _To the extent the EFs are implemented._

Furthermore, AI in governance has direct and indirect impact in

- Politics and political shifts
- Policing
- Justice
- Safeguarding of valuable systems and institutions (ex. democracy, republic system, etc.)

### EXPANSION: Impact of AI and new opportunities and challenges
- Industrial usage
    - O: Efficiency + Efficacy
    - C: Safety ⇒ Explainability + Transparency
    - C: Upskilling human workforce
- Research usage
    - O: Content generation for research work
    - O: Automated resource-gathering and interpretation
    - O: Automated experimentation
    - C: Validation of research methodology and results
- Creative content usage
    - O: Creative content generation

### EXPANSION: Need for ethical considerations in development and deployment of AI
We see above that AI does present actual ethical issues that, due to its impact–which is wide-ranging and significant in many areas–these ethical issues can have (and often do have) a large impact as well, on individual users as well as the society at large.

Ethics is the study of the values by which humans must guide their choices; this includes not just the identification of the values but also of the means of achieving them, namely virtues and principles. There are various ethical frameworks, but all share the same basic goal: to guide the choices of humans on a fundamental level, i.e. in a long-range, big-picture view. Ethics is relevant because of two facts: (1) humans are goal-driven entities, i.e. they must, by their nature, pursue one or more goals, and (2) humans have volition, which means they have the ability to choose and not be merely driven by instinct or impulse. These two points mean that while humans must pursue goals to be what they are (the most basic goal being survival), the goals are not automatic, especially beyond the intrinsic, impulse-driven motives. What must humans choose, how and why–these are the questions ethics answers. As a result, ethics forms the bedrock of long-term human existence; without ethical principles, we would be reduced to an animalistic state of survival.

AI is a field that has deep and wide-ranging impacts on (1) knowledge acquisition, (2) decision-making and (3) productivity. These are fundamental aspects of human life, especially long-range, and thus–due to this also being the domain of ethics–the impacts and potential of AI is an important consideration within the field of applied ethics.

## Information from module supervisor
Your final coursework will be scrutinized for any generative AI content presented as your own. Therefore it is important to note the following guidelines when submitting your final coursework. If i have any concerns or doubts regarding your final coursework its authenticity I will be following the [guidelines of the QMUL academic misconduct policy](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/governance-and-legal-services/student-appeals/academic-misconduct/) and referring your assingment to the EECS Academic misconduct officer for further investigation. This means your assessment marks will not be released until a full investigation has been carried out by the Academic Misconduct Officer and QMUL ACCO.

Universities are required by the Office for Students to ensure that assessments are valid, reliable and ‘designed in a way that minimises the opportunities for academic misconduct and facilitates the detection of such misconduct where it does occur’ (Office for Students, 24 Nov 2022). So we do need to ensure that assessments are robust and ensure that they provide opportunities for students to demonstrate their achievements against the stated learning outcomes through their original work.  So it is important that you read the attached link. 

_The final coursework will be made available to you in week 4._

A majority of the knowledge and learning for the final coursework will be completed by week 7. Therefore students may start working on the final coursework as early as week 8 and start showing me (module organizer) drafts to ensure that you're on the right track.  If you choose to start your final coursework in week 12 please note that you will then only have 2 weeks to complete your final coursework.  Therefore you should begin working on your final coursework from week 8 so that I can support you and help you with areas in which you're in doubt. At any given time you may book a 1-1 feedback session with me to clarify doubts regarding the coursework or to show any draft work.
